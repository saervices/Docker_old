# Memory: Language Preferences

## Rule: English for Code Artifacts

**All code artifacts must be written in English**, including:

- Code comments (inline and block)
- Documentation text (headings, descriptions, explanations)
- Commit messages
- README files
- Configuration file comments
- Error messages and log output descriptions

## Rule: Chat Language Matches User

Chat responses should match the language the user writes in (German or English).
Code artifacts always remain in English regardless of chat language.

## Rationale

- Consistency across the entire codebase
- Better collaboration with international contributors
- Standard practice in software development
- Natural conversation in the user's preferred language
